It features a dual-core Arm Cortex-M0+ processor, 256 KB of on-board SRAM, and support for various communication interfaces such as USB, SPI, and I2C.
The board is compatible with the Arduino programming environment and can be used for a wide range of projects, including robotics, IoT, and more (see <<rp2040>>).

Make the most of the dual core 32-bit Arm速 Cortex速-M0+ to make Internet of Things projects with Bluetooth速 and WiFi connectivity thanks to the U-blox速 Nina W102 module.

Dive into real-world projects with the onboard accelerometer, gyroscope, RGB LED and microphone.
